        <h3>Coding & Development</h3>
        <p>I started coding in 2016 and since then I have gathered knowledge on Programming in general. I am not the best but I will say I am somewhat decent. My stacks at the moment are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Dart, React js. I still have a lot to learn, and I hope in coming years I am able to improve on this skill of mine. </p>

        <h3>Professional</h3>
        <p>I am very self aware and I am very critical in my thinking. I tend to be the biggest critics of myself hence why I am always pushing to improve and be useful where ever I go. I am a good team player and I have very good communication skills, I know how to pass across information clearly and simple.</p>

        <h3>Gaming</h3>
        <p>Gaming has been a very integral part of my life as it is sort of my coping mechanism. I play video games to relax, get over a horrible day or simply block out the <b>'noise'</b>. I have always played games whether on mobile phones or console but i got my first console in august 2008, I was 7 years old back then. Since then I have grown up to like gaming and my favourite games are <b>Fifa(football/soccer)</b>, <b>2k(nba)</b> and <b>Apex Legends(an online battle royale game)</b> </p>

        <h3>Sports</h3>
        <p>Sports has always been part of my life even though I am not very athletic. When you grow up around people playing sports and you start to play yourself, it becomes a way of life. My favourite sport to play is football(european football) cause it is the most played sport in my country hence was the first sport i was introuced to. I sometimes play basketball and table tennis.</p>
